        <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="lead-text">Soft Earth Ceramics began in 2019 when founder Maya Chen started teaching weekend pottery workshops out of a small rented garage. What started as a way to share her love of clay quickly grew into something more—a gathering place for people seeking creative expression and connection. Today, we occupy a sun-filled studio in the heart of downtown, where we welcome over 200 students each year. Our focus has always been on community: building a space where people feel comfortable learning, making mistakes, and discovering the quiet joy of working with their hands.</p>

            <h3>Slow Craft</h3>
            <p>In a fast-paced world, pottery asks us to slow down. We embrace the unhurried process of shaping clay—there are no shortcuts, and that's the point. Every piece takes time, attention, and care.</p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>We're committed to mindful making. We reclaim and recycle clay, source materials from responsible suppliers, and minimize waste in our firing processes. Good craft should be good for the earth.</p>

            <p>Everyone has the capacity to create. We cultivate an environment where curiosity is encouraged, experimentation is welcome, and there's no pressure to be perfect—just present.</p>
